# stack
This is a LIFO stack in JavaScript.

We can use:

s.add(2) and pass an item in, to add the item in the stack (2 is an example).
s.remove() to remove the last item and return it on screen.
s.last() to have a look at the last item added in the stack.
s.count() to see how many items are in the stack at any moment.

The stack is not accessible. 
This comes with an item already inside. 

Thank you!
